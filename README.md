# Smart-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Detecting the drowsiness level of the driver and notify or alert him if he reach the limit of the drowsiness hazrd level

We will follow three main techniques to detect the drowsiness that are
1. Tracking eye movements
2. Monitering the pulse rate
3. Monitering the vehicale movements. 

## Tracking eye movements

  We use the Convolutional Neural Netwoks algorithms to detect and track the eye. The CNN algorithm implements from scratch according to VGG-16 architecture. 

## Monitering the pulse rate

## Monitering the vehicale movements.
